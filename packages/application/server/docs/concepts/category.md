# Categories

Categories can be used to mark and filter content. A content can have multiple categories assigned. Members of a profile
can define and manage categories in the category overview or while creating new content. A category can be configured
with additional settings etc:

 - Hide in filter nav
 - Hide in content category list (e.g. task entry)
 - Only show content marked with this category on active matching filter
 - Do not use this on tasks
 - Do not use this on activities
 - Do not use this on milestones
 - Do not use this on messages
 - Do not use this on posts
 - Do not use this for statistics
 - etc..

## Use-cases

### Filter

Most views will provide a category filter, in order to filter out specific entries. If a category is marked with
"Only include content on matching filter" we can use categories for creating sub-sections of a view. E.g. Tasks 
marked with "Shopping" should not appear on the default view, but only if I select the "Shopping" (or other) matching
filter.

### Stream

Streams can also be filtered by category, once a category filter is active, all new content will be created with the
active categories. This allows us to easily create sub-streams within a profile.

### Statistics

We can use categories in order to create statistics e.g.: How is my health journal related with the score
of activities marked with 'Sport'.
