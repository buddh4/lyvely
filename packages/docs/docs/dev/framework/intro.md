# Introduction

Custom feature modules are usually organized into a monorepo with **web**, **interface**, and **api** packages. 
While the interface package is not mandatory, we strongly recommend its use. This recommendation aims to prevent code 
duplication and facilitate the creation of type-safe interfaces.

Within a feature monorepo, both the **web** and **api** packages have the capability to run their development servers 
right out of the box. This feature is designed to simplify the process of testing and debugging your custom features. 
In most cases, it provides an effective environment for your development needs.

By following this organizational approach, you can efficiently manage your custom features, ensure code reusability, 
and streamline your development and testing processes.
