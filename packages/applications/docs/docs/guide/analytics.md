# Analytics

The Analytics feature is a powerful tool for evaluating data such as habit and journal data as well as profile scores by
creating customized charts. This feature allows you to add and combine multiple chart series to
analyze the correlations between your profile data. The following chart series are available by default:

- **Profile Score**: Visualizes the progression of the profile score over time, allowing you to track and analyze
  trends in performance or changes in score throughout a specified period optionally filtered by tags.
- **User Score**: Visualizes scores grouped by users. You can choose specific users and/or include the currently active
  user. Optionally you can filter for scores related to certain tags.
