# Health Recipes

A very important aspect of our lives should be to lead a healthy lifestyle. In this day and age of office jobs, the lure
of junk food, social media, and other distractions, it has become increasingly difficult to listen to the needs of our 
own body and mind. An unhealthy lifestyle can affect every aspect of our lives, from our self-perception to our personal 
and professional relationships.

Lyvely offers various tools aimed at nurturing and monitoring the important choices in your life. It is designed to track
and analyze your development while ensuring you have fun in the process. In the following guides, you will find examples
of how you can use the Lyvely platform to improve your health.

The following recipes serve as inspiration and guideline for your own Lyvely journey and are constantly being expanded.

:::warning
While the following recipes and tips can help you manage your health, they are not a substitute for professional medical
advice or treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional for any medical concerns.

## Introduction

In case you haven't created a profile yet, create a new profile with the usage selection `Health`. This will set up your
profile with all features you need for managing your health. Note, all settings can be changed later if you wish, so
in case you already created a profile without the `Health` usage, just can still just follow the recipes described
below.

Most of the recipes described in this guide will consist of creating Tasks, Habits, Journals and Charts which are 
types of content. You can tag those content with certain tags to categorize content. It is a good idea to create multiple 
tags for tracking your health or even certain health aspects, for example:

- `Health`: This should serve as general tag for marking health related tasks, habits and resource and should be created
by `Health` usage setting when creating your profile.
- `Body`, `Mental`: You could separate between activities for mental or physical health.
- `Resource`: For tagging links of articles or other resources.

Tags can either be created in the `Tags` view within your profile or on the fly, when creating new content.

:::tip
The **score** value you choose for your activities is highly dependent on your own goals and should reflect the priority
and how much effort it costs you. If you start with a new habit you may assign a higher score until you've successfully
integrated into your life.

:::tip
Start small with just few habits in order to not overwhelm yourself and lose motivation.

## Assemble Resources and Knowledge

Lyvely is ideal for managing information as links and texts simply by submitting them in the **Stream** view:

- Open the `Stream` view within your profile.
- Submit a text for example: `Healthy Food Recipes`.
- Click on the message bubble to enter the `Detail VIew`.
- Add a tag `Health` and `Recipes`.
- Submit links or texts to your newly created content.

It is up to you to alternatively add all your recipes with tags to the main stream instead of creating a parent content
entry.

## Drink 2 Litres a Day
