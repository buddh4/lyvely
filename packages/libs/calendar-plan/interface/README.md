## Lyvely Calendar Plan

This library can be used to implement calendar-planning features. A calendar-plan is a sortable UI component that
organizes list entries into Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly, and Unscheduled intervals based on item priority.
This component is integral to many core platform features.
